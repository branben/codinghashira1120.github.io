Brandon's 9.2 Front-End Project

- User will be able to select a random hero or villain from an array of hero's and villains gathered from the "Superhero API"
- Hero's & Villain's are seperated by their "alignment" 
- An opposing random hero will be selected and the two will battle and one will be the victor
- Battle will be dictated similar to pokemon, based on powerstats such as intelligence, strength, speed, durability, power and combat
- Attack, Defend
- (Hero's or villains may do more or less damage based on their relationship)
- Webpage will contain a form for users to select a random hero with a buttom, or a section of 20 random hero's from an array generated randomly each time the user presses submit from 700+ heroes & villains.
